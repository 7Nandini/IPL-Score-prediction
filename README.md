# IPL-Score-prediction
This is my first machine learning project which is a part of ongoing competition "Cricket and Coding" organized by IITM
In this competition, we had to predict the runs scored by the batting team after each innings.
I used linear regression model algorithm to predict the score.
My overall rank in this compition is 103.
